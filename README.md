Actually jus have a simple render of figures and textures binding.

If you are on window, you need to use _Visual Studio 2022_. Just run the [generateProject.bat](/generateProject.bat). If you are using any other version of _Visual Studio_ below that just modify the command on the `.bat` to for example: vs2019.

Try to use and modify the sandbox to create amazing things!
